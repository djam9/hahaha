   <h1>Potatos' life</h1>
   <p > Well when I was a Maris Piper all I wanted to be was the most regal of potatoes I of course wanted to be a King Edward.

I looked down on Majestics and Kerr's Pink but I did have an almighty crush on Charlotte. Oh how I wanted to cream her up into a lovely fluffy pile of yummyness but alas my dreams were smashed, my dreams boiled away to nothing and my heart was chipped and deep fried until burnt to a crisp.

So here ends the terrible tale of the sad potato, alone on a couch, watching Smash adverts on TV.</p>

     <h1>The origin of potato</h1>
     <p id="h"> The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. Potato may be applied to both the plant and the edible tuber.[2] Common or slang terms for the potato include tater and spud. Potatoes have become a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. Potatoes are the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[3] Tubers produce glycoalkaloids in small amounts. If green sections (sprouts and skins) of the plant are exposed to light the tuber can produce a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.</p>
